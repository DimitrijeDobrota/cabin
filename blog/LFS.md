# Linux From Scratch - non-POSIX compliant bloat

Taken from [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) site:
> Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step
instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source
code. 

This description really summarizes it nicely and it is exactly what you are
getting.  To understand the reasoning behind this clickbait title, it's
important for me to clarify my expectations of this project as well as the project itself.

## Linux From Scratch

Linux From Scratch is a project that provides you with a book that contains a
step-by-step instructions on how to build your own Linux system. It is supposed to:

- Teach people how a Linux system works internally
- Produce a very compact Linux system
- Be extremely flexible
- Offer you added security

LFS deliverers on all promises hands down.

It's not exactly a book for beginners as some important topics like disk
partitioning are not explained in depth, and as decent proficiency in terminal
is assumed for a smooth ride.

If proper amount of care is not taken there are quite a few headache that may arise down
the road, but if proper backups were made, (almost) every issue can be resolved.
